          <h3>The essentials</h3>
          <p>These are the mainstream places where you can find everything you need. You can shop online as well as in-store.
            IKEA is probably one of the most famous furniture retailers and offers modern and simple designs. IKEA’s main branch is in Sofia, 
            and they have online delivery centers in Varna, Burgas, and Plovdiv. Their services include delivery, furniture assembly, kitchen 
            sizing, and installation. COMO is a furniture hypermarket located in Sofia. They offer furniture delivery and kitchen installation 
            services. Their website is also available in English. Aiko and Domko are Bulgarian furniture stores that you can find in most major 
            towns. They offer delivery, assembly, old furniture removal, kitchen measurement, and curtain sewing. Their websites have English

            <h3>Bulgarian traditions</h3>
            <p>If you would like to add a more authentic, local flair to your home, you can incorporate some typical Bulgarian elements into 
              your decorations. The traditional Bulgarian home is cozy and inviting, centered around the dining table. It includes natural 
              materials like wood, stone and clay, and a big fireplace. To feel that atmosphere for yourself in Sofia, you can visit a 
              traditional Bulgarian restaurant. Some classic decor elements include Troyan clay pottery, tablecloths with traditional regional 
              embroidery, Rhodope wool blankets, kilim rugs, wooden figurines, copper objects. These are best found in souvenir shops when 
              traveling in Bulgaria, and it’s a great way to support local artists. Blaiv and Rodopska Takan are traditional textile stores 
              based in Sevlievo and Smolyan, respectively. You can order traditional blankets, bedspreads, and tablecloths online.</p>
